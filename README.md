# A-Study-on-Prototype-Based-Online-CL-Methods
This project implements prototype-based online continual learning methods from my MSc thesis at University of Padova (2024-2025). It enhances replay-based CL with PDI. Prototype Distance Interpolation (PDI) is a technique used in this thesis to enhance continual learning by interpolating between class prototypes based on their distances.
